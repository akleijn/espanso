              Hey! The link to the streaming platform is ${STREAMYARD_LINK_HERE}
              
              However, for sharing purposes, the video itself will be live here: ${YOUTUBE_LINK_HERE} and the recording will also be saved on that link afterwards.

              This invitation is for 15 minutes before broadcast time so that we can all do a tech check for audio/video/screenshare settings. Looking forward to it! :)
